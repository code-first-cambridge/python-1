# Here, we assign a value to a label.  Specifically, we assign the string value
# "Peter" to the label called *name*.
name = "Peter"

# We can then use the label in our code.  Wherever Python sees a label, it will
# use the value of the label instead.
print "Hello", name
print "How are you today?"

# Question: What happens if you try to use a lable that does not exist?
