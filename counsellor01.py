# When Python runs this script, it'll read one line at a time, and execute each
# line in turn.

# It will ignore lines, like this one, that begin with a hash sign.  We call
# these "comments".

# When the next line is executed, it will display some text on the screen.
print "Hello Peter!"

# Text that is in double quotes is called a string value.  There are other
# types of values, such as numbers and lists, which we'll come to soon.

# When the next line is executed, it will display some more text on the screen.
print "How're you today?"

# Question: What happens if you replace the double quotes with single quotes?
